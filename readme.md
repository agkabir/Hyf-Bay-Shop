# 1. Filter products

A very normal usecase for a product site is that a **user wants to search for some product** or find products that are cheaper than a set price. Lets implement that functionality for a user!

## 1.1. Filter products based on name
When the **user types in the input field** all the product names that matched with the text input are shown.
## 1.2. Filter products based on max price
Lets help a user to find cheap products! When the **user writes a maximum price** all the products price that are less than or equal to the maximum price are shown if available.

## 1.2. Filter products based on name and max price
Lets help a user to find cheap products based on both name and max price! When the **user writes name and maximum price** all the products that matched with the text input and prices are less than or equal to the maximum price are shown if available.
